title: Gamma Ray Optics Simulation
weight: 10

**Still under construction**

GrOptics is a detailed simulation program for ray-tracing Cherenkov photons through large arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. Shower packages, such as GrISU  and CORSIKA , provide Cherenkov pho- tons after conversion to GrISU format. The output to a ROOT file records individual photons striking the camera surface. The package models both VERITAS Davies-Cotton (DC) and Schwarzchild-Coudee (SC, SEGSC) telescopes with all telescope parameters taken from input files. I added new telescope models for the Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope prototype being constructed in Tuscon, Arizona. I also maintained the repository till December 2017.
