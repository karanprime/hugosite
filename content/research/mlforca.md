title: Automated Classification of Cellular Automata
weight: 10
---

**Still under construction**

While cellular automata can be classified manually for small spaces (such as 256 elementary CA), we need more efficient and automatic methods to classify them over bigger spaces. I used unsupervised classifying methods to do so. To make it more effective, I came up with preprocessing functions and feature sets for the classifiers.
